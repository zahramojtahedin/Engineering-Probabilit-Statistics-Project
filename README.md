# Engineering-Probabilit-Statistics-Project
A project in MATLAB for the Engineering probability and Statistics course whose goal was to detect the value of resistors with more than 1Ω difference with probability greater than 0.9, with a suitable hypothesis test with a confidence level of 0.95, at the output of the 100Ω resistance production line.
